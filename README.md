This project is intended to demonstrate what appear to be bugs in how Core Data 
manages memory.  In several cases, Core Data is not releasing allocated memory as expected.
 
Please see more details in the file CoreDataMemoryBugViewController.m

This controller contains a number of test cases (selectable with a single define) to 
demonstrate different issues.



My Environment:

Xcode 4.5.2 (4G2008a)

Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 (11G63)

iPhone 6.0 simulator
